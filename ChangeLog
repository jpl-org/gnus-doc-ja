	* gnus-doc-ja: The project has started.

	We aim to translate all the Info manuals of Gnus into Japanese.
	Fortunately, we have the inheritance of the Semi-gnus project, of
	which Yoshiki Hayashi and the volunteers made the Japanese manuals
	being specialized to Semi-gnus.  Don't forget that Kazuyuki Ienaga
	translated the Gnus v5.0.15 manual into Japanese for the first
	time.  Let's start translating, making full use of those fortunes.

	There were the following files in the CVS trunk initially:

	.cvsignore ChangeLog Makefile.in README.ja TRANSLATION.ja
	configure configure.ac doclicense.texi emacs-mime-ja.texi
	gnus-faq-ja.texi gnus-ja.texi gnus-news-ja.texi gnus-terms.ja
