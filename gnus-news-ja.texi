@itemize @bullet

@item Upgrading from previous (stable) version if you have used No Gnus.

If you have tried No Gnus (the unstable Gnus branch leading to this
release) but went back to a stable version, be careful when upgrading
to this version.  In particular, you will probably want to remove the
@file{~/News/marks} directory (perhaps selectively), so that flags are
read from your @file{~/.newsrc.eld} instead of from the stale marks
file, where this release will store flags for nntp.  See a later entry
for more information about nntp marks.  Note that downgrading isn't
safe in general.

@item The nntp back end store article marks in @file{~/News/marks}.

The directory can be changed using the (customizable) variable
@code{nntp-marks-directory}, and marks can be disabled using the
(back end) variable @code{nntp-marks-is-evil}.  The advantage of this
is that you can copy @file{~/News/marks} (using rsync, scp or
whatever) to another Gnus installation, and it will realize what
articles you have read and marked.  The data in @file{~/News/marks}
has priority over the same data in @file{~/.newsrc.eld}.

@item
Picons can be displayed right from the textual address, see
@code{gnus-picon-style}.  @ref{Picons}.

@item
You can import and export your @acronym{RSS} subscriptions from
@acronym{OPML} files.  @xref{RSS}.

@item
The option @code{mm-fill-flowed} can be used to disable treatment of
format=flowed messages.  Also, flowed text is disabled when sending
inline @acronym{PGP} signed messages.

@item You can now drag and drop attachments to the Message buffer.

@item The option @code{message-yank-empty-prefix} now controls how
empty lines are prefixed in cited text.
@xref{(message)Insertion Variables}.

@item @acronym{ANSI} @acronym{SGR} control sequences can be transformed
using @kbd{W A}.

@acronym{ANSI} sequences are used in some Chinese hierarchies for
highlighting articles (@code{gnus-article-treat-ansi-sequences}).

@item International host names (@acronym{IDNA}) can now be decoded
inside article bodies using @kbd{W i}
(@code{gnus-summary-idna-message}).  This require that GNU Libidn
(@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/}) has been installed.

@item Gnus includes an Emacs Lisp @acronym{SASL} library.

This provide a clean @acronym{API} to @acronym{SASL} mechanisms from
within Emacs.  The user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier
situation, include support for @acronym{DIGEST}-@acronym{MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}.

@item ManageSieve connections uses the @acronym{SASL} library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for @acronym{DIGEST-MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}, when the server support it.

@item Gnus include a password cache mechanism in password.el.

It is enabled by default (see @code{password-cache}), with a short
timeout of 16 seconds (see @code{password-cache-expiry}).  If
@acronym{PGG} is used as the @acronym{PGP} back end, the @acronym{PGP}
passphrase is managed by this mechanism.  Passwords for ManageSieve
connections are managed by this mechanism, after quering the user about
whether to do so.

@item @acronym{IMAP} identity (@acronym{RFC} 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus do not send any information about itself, but you can
customize it using the variable @code{nnimap-id}.

@item The @file{all.SCORE} file can be edited from the group buffer
using @kbd{W e}.

@item Gnus now MIME decode articles even when they lack "MIME-Version" header.
This changes the default of @code{gnus-article-loose-mime}.

@item Gnus now view DNS master files sent as text/dns using dns-mode.

@item Gnus now support the ``hashcash'' client puzzle anti-spam idea.
See the Gnus manual, section Hashcash, for more information.  Use
@code{(setq message-generate-hashcash t)} to enable.

@item Gnus supports new limiting commands in the Summary buffer:
@kbd{/ r} (@code{gnus-summary-limit-to-replied}) and @kbd{/ R}
(@code{gnus-summary-limit-to-recipient}).  @ref{Limiting}.

@item Gnus supports a new sort command in the Summary buffer:
@kbd{C-c C-s C-t} (@code{gnus-summary-sort-by-recipient}).  @ref{Summary
Sorting}.

@item The @code{nnrss} back end now supports multilingual text.
Non-@acronym{ASCII} group names for the @code{nnrss} groups are also
supported.  @xref{RSS}.

@item URLs inside OpenPGP: headers are retrieved and imported to your
PGP key ring when you click on them.

@item Gnus uses narrowing to hide headers in Message buffers.
The @code{References} header is hidden by default.  To make all
headers visible, use @code{(setq message-hidden-headers nil)}.

@item @code{gnus-decay-scores} can be a regexp matching score files.
This allows to decay only adaptive score files.  @ref{Score Decays}.

@item @acronym{S/MIME} now feature @acronym{LDAP} user certificate searches.
You need to configure the server in @code{smime-ldap-host-list}.

@item Strings prefixed to the @code{To} and @code{Newsgroup} headers in
summary lines when using @code{gnus-ignored-from-addresses} can be
customized with @code{gnus-summary-to-prefix} and
@code{gnus-summary-newsgroup-prefix}.  @ref{To From Newsgroups}.
