These are the complete Japanese translations of the Gnus Info manuals,
corresponding to No Gnus v0.4.

Installation
============
% ./configure
% make
% make install

You can specify Emacs which is used to format the Info files, and the
destination directory in which the Info files are installed:

% ./configure --with-emacs=EMACS --infodir=INFODIR

To know those default values, look into Makefile after running the
configure script without argument.  The value for EMACS doesn't allow
to have directory components like /usr/local/bin/emacs, so you have to
specify the PATH environment variable if it is needed.  For example:

% ./configure --with-emacs=emacs-21.4 --infodir=/usr/local/info

If you prefer to read those Japanese Info manuals when typing `C-cC-i'
in Gnus buffers or typing `M-x message-info' in message buffers, you
can add the following advice to the ~/.gnus.el file:

(defadvice Info-goto-node (around prefer-japanese-edition activate)
  "Prefer Japanese edition of Gnus Info manuals."
  (if (and (not (eq major-mode 'Info-mode))
	   (string-match "\\`(\\(emacs-mime\\|gnus-coding\
\\|gnus-faq\\|gnus\\|gnus-news\\|message\\|pgg\\|sasl\\|sieve\\))"
			 (ad-get-arg 0)))
      (let ((orig (ad-get-arg 0)))
	(ad-set-arg 0 (concat (substring (ad-get-arg 0)
					 0 (1- (match-end 0)))
			      "-ja"
			      (substring (ad-get-arg 0)
					 (1- (match-end 0)))))
	(condition-case nil
	    ad-do-it
	  (error
	   (ad-set-arg 0 orig)
	   ad-do-it)))
    ad-do-it))

Gnus version
============
This package corresponds to the version of Gnus released from the Gnus
Towers, not the version of the one distributed with Emacs.  When two
or more versions of Gnusae are released in a short period of time, the
most development-oriented version in them will be targeted.

Where to get this package
=========================
http://www.jpl.org/gnus-doc-ja.html
or ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/gnus-doc-ja/

The tarball corresponding to the tarball xgnus-m.n.tar.gz which is the
released version of Gnus is xgnus-m.n-doc-ja.tar.gz.

Printing
========
You can also make PDF or PS files.  To do that, you need to have
prepared properly the environment in which you are able to use the
commands dvipdfmx, jbibtex, pdvips, ptex, and texi2dvi.  Perform the
following commands after running the configure script:

% make pdf

or

% make ps

Otherwise, you may use the ready-made PDF files, which can be found in
the same place where this package exists.

Anonymous CVS
=============
You can get the manuals of which translating is in progress:

% cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.m17n.org:/cvs/root login
This is necessary only first.  Just type the RET key when you are
asked for the password.

% cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.m17n.org:/cvs/root checkout gnus-doc-ja

Join the translation
====================
Anyone is welcome.  The place where the translation is being done is:

% CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d :ext:cvs@cvs.m17n.org:/cvs/root

The name of the repository is gnus-doc-ja.  If you wish to have a
write access, send an e-mail with a user name which you desire to use
and the ssh2 public key to <cvs@cvs.m17n.org>.

*NOTE*
There are many implicit conventions on terms, ways to write English
words in Japanese text, turns of phrases, etc.  Please follow the
conventional ways as much as possible, looking at the ones that have
already been translated.

Discussion
==========
Use the semi-gnus-ja mailing list <semi-gnus-ja@meadowy.org> to
discuss for the time being.
