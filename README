These are the complete Japanese translations of the Gnus Info manuals,
corresponding to Gnus v5.13.

Installation
============
% ./configure
% make
% make install

You can specify Emacs which is used to format the Info files, and the
destination directory in which the Info files are installed:

% ./configure --with-emacs=EMACS --infodir=INFODIR

To know those default values, look into Makefile after running the
configure script without argument.  The value for EMACS doesn't allow
to have directory components like /usr/local/bin/emacs, so you have to
specify the PATH environment variable if it is needed.  For example:

% ./configure --with-emacs=emacs-30.2 --infodir=/usr/local/info

If you prefer to read those Japanese Info manuals when typing `C-cC-i'
in Gnus buffers or typing `M-x message-info' in message buffers, you
can add the following advice to the ~/.gnus.el file:

(advice-add
 'Info-goto-node :around
 ;; Prefer Japanese edition of Gnus Info manuals.
 (lambda (oldfun &rest args)
   (if (and (not (eq major-mode 'Info-mode))
	    (string-match "\\`(\\(emacs-mime\\|epa\\|gnus-coding\
\\|gnus-faq\\|gnus\\|gnus-news\\|message\\|sasl\\|sieve\\))"
			  (car args)))
       (condition-case nil
	   (apply oldfun
		  (cons
		   (concat (substring (car args) 0 (1- (match-end 0)))
			   "-ja"
			   (substring (car args) (1- (match-end 0))))
		   (cdr args)))
	 (error
	  (apply oldfun args)))
     (apply oldfun args)))
 '((name . prefer-japanese-edition)))

Gnus version
============
This package corresponds to the version of Gnus distributed with Emacs.

Where to get this package
=========================
http://www.jpl.org/gnus-doc-ja.html

The tarball corresponding to Gnus vP.Q bundled with Emacs R.S is

You can also make PDF files.  To do that, you need to have installed
the packages Texinfo the version >=6.3, and either (or both) of XeTeX

% make pdf

Otherwise, you may use the ready-made PDF files, which can be found in
the same place where this package exists.
